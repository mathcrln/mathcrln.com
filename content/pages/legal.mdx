As I wish my relationship with you to be built around trust and simplicity, I want to be as clear as possible about the work I do here as well as on my other platforms around the web. Although I will do my best to cover all the possible areas, you are always free to shoot me an email or send a message through the contact page if you have any more questions concerning my process and my ethics.

## Who I am

My name is Mathieu Céraline. I am a 23 years old student who likes reading and writing. You can discover more about me here.

I am the owner, the creator, and the webmaster of this blog. Although to make this blog accessible to you, I worked with multiple entities :

- Vercel
- Next.js 
- GraphCMS

Even though I worked with these companies as well as some others to make this platform public, I can’t be held responsible for any issue that would be a result of their design (if there were ever any issues).

## What personal data do I collect and why I collect it

### Comments

When you or any other visitors leave comments on the site I collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it (You can read the Gravatar service privacy policy). After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Contact forms
Just like with the comments, I collect the data shown in the contact form as well as your IP address and your browser user agent string to help spam detection.

### Cookies
If you leave a comment on my site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies.

### Embedded content from other websites
If most of the work displayed on this website is mine, some complementary elements might come other websites or platforms (YouTube, Unsplash, Spotify, etc.).

Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect datas about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. Though, I will personally do my best to reduce the use of external sources and their methods of tracking if I consider them to be either irrelevant to me or non-respectful of my ethics.

### Analytics
In order to keep creating consistent and meaningful content, I use a tracking software powered by Google and called « Google Analytics ».

This software tracks anonymous data about the pages you visit on this website, the duration of your visits, your internet provider, or your location.

Those data are only accessible to me and I don’t sell or share them to anyone, nor do I use them for marketing purposes.

Who I share your data with
I don’t share your data with anyone and I personally refuse to display any sort of auto-generated ads on any part of the blog. I want to state that I strongly dislike and disagree with the practice of some advertisement companies using your data in order to generate more income.

How long I retain your data
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so I can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on my website (if any), I also store the personal information they provide in their user profiles. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username).

## What rights do you have over your data
If you have an account on this site or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data I hold about you, including any data you have provided to me. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Where I send your data
As mentioned earlier, comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

Depending on the information you provide me, your data may be sent in a secured way to the appropriate services. For example, if you subscribe to my newsletter, your email address, as well as your first name, will be sent to the mailing provider I use, Mailchimp.

## How I protect your data
Although I don’t own much of your data, I make it my responsibility to protect it to the best of my ability. Here are some of the steps I take to make sure that all of your visits to my website are secure :

SSL Encryption: This website is encrypted as you can see with the use of the ‘HTTPS protocol in the search bar.
Regular updates: I do my best to stay up to date with every software I use with this platform.
I trust very few third-party software: as mentioned earlier I do my best to limit the use of third-party apps and software if I can help it. It reduces the probability of potential breaches or issues.
Newsletter
Lastly, I send a newsletter every month. You can find more information and subscribe here.

Mailchimp is the service provider I use to send the newsletter and I take every step necessary to ensure that it stays GDPR compliant (double opt-in, etc.). I only ask for the information I use in the newsletter, as to say: your first name and your email address.
