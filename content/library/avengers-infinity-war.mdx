Should we sacrifice a few to save the many? As Marvel Studios finally uncovered the first title in the Avengers: Infinity War duology, here is my review of a movie that many announced to be ambitious. **Though beware. If my reviews usually aren't, this particular one is gonna be spoilers. So if you haven't seen the movie I highly suggest you stop reading now (and come back later).**

I have been pondering quite a lot about whether I should publish this movie or not. The more something is important to me, the more I have a hard time reviewing and writing about it and it wasn't easy for me to gather my thoughts about this new movie by Marvel Studios. Especially as I (at first) didn't want to spoil anyone and I felt like anything I could say would reveal to be spoilery. But here I am, more than a month after seeing the movie, finally telling giving you my very detailed opinion.

## Synopsis

The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe. \[Source: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/)\]

## Ambitious: 24 freaking characters

It's almost surprising to see how many main characters actually play in the movie. 24 freaking ones. I wonder how they all fitted on the poster in the first place. As we all grew to know the characters in their own storyline — Iron Man ten years ago, Docteur Strange, Spiderman and the Guardians of the Galaxy more recently —, **we couldn't help but get excited but also a bit anxious about the crossover.** We would finally get to see them all together but ... how could it even make sense?

But despite this very ambitious bet, the Russo Brothers and the Marvel Studios kept their promise. **Divided and tiny mixed group with their own adventures, we had a chance to see every one of our favorite characters on screen without feeling completely lost.** It was not perfect though: some secondary characters had too much time onscreen and the transitions between two groups often felt frustrating. But overall the results is really interesting.

The movie doesn't feel rushed and we have the appropriate time to feel a broad range of emotions.

## Beautiful

### Beautiful visuals

I'm not sure I can say how many times I've been smiling from astonishment while watching the movie. I watched it the first time in 3D, the second time in 2D (both were beautiful), and honestly, I could myself watch it a third time in 4D. From the quality of the image capture to the production design itself, you can see that the movie have been well thought out for every way of watching.

My favorite scenes in chronological order:

-   Tony putting his nano-particule suit on,
-   Thanos waking up with the soul stone in his hand,
-   Thor arriving in Wakanda.

### Beautiful story

I could ramble a lot here, but let's try to be straight: the movie was not perfect, we can spot some plot-holes (Loki, Hulk, etc) but the whole was pretty well done. It introduces the "new characters" to the rest of the band and is a continuity of Black Panther _([read my review](/library/black-panther/))_ — whose universe we discovered earlier this year — since the final fight is happening in Wakanda.

> **T'Challa:** You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust, and blood.

As we discover the adventures (or should I say misadventures?) of our dear Avengers in their hope to save the Galaxy from the grip (literally) of Thanos, the suspense is at its highest. We don't know what to expect or what not to expect and, I believe we were certainly all surprised (spoilers excluded) by the ending.

**The story was beautiful because it was well written but it was mostly beautiful because it had meaning.**

> **Captain America:** We don’t trade lives.

From the quest of Thanos to make the world a better place in a very "greater good" approach to the fight of Earth's mightiest heroes to defend the principles they believe in, the movie made us think. **More than just a regular super-hero movie, he makes us rethink our approach on leadership, human values, grief and so many other things.**

## Thanos

Oh Thanos. Thanos, Thanos, Thanos, why can't I hate you. I mean, I do, very much, but I also don't. As much as I disagree with everyone of his actions, I can't get myself to completely despise him.

> **Thanos:** In time, you will know what it's like to lose? To feel so desperately that you're right. Yet to fail all the same. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives.

From the storyline to the visuals, The Russo Brothers really did a great job picturing an evil, yet very empathetic character. As you discover the story of the intergalactic vile despot whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, and  use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality, you also come accross a very  conflicted personality. Almost human like. He has respect for his opponents and, most importantly, he has his own twisted, yet very real, sense of fairness.

> **Thanos:** You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. I hope they remember you.

**Almost a Thanos movie, the vilian is probably the most interesting part of it all.**  ![](images/avengers-infinity-war-thanos.jpeg)

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — 5 out of 5 stars

Here is how I break my rating into a logical system for [all movies](https://mathcrln.com/culture/cinema/) :

-   **Acting : 1/1**⭐ (Not that surprising since we have been following them all movies after movies)
-   **Writing : 1/1**⭐ (Finally a storyline that surprise pretty much everyone)
-   **Production Design : 1/1**⭐ (I watched it in 3D and in 2D, both were beautiful)
-   **Directing : 1/1**⭐ (The Russo Brothers did an absolutely great job)
-   **Sound/Music : 1/1**⭐ (Do I really need to tell you how great it was?)

We could always find annoying little details (I certainly did) so ... I could have given less for "critic purposes" but I believe I am being fair by saying this movie deserves a 5 stars review.

## Should you watch it?
