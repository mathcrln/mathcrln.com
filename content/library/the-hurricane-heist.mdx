I usually don't talk that much about movies I don't like on the blog. But, for a change, I'll tell you what I didn't like in **The Hurricane Heist** movie, by the producers of Fast &  Furious and xXx.

## Synopsis

After the announcement of a Category 5 hurricane and the evacuation of the city, thieves decide to break into a highly secure federal building to steal $ 600 million in bills supposed to be destroyed.

## GOOD POINT : Mother Nature is on fire 🔥

I usually really love movies like that. Movies where we get to see Mother Nature in action : storms, lightning bolts, wind, tsunami. Hell, I even like this in real life. Not the casualties, obviously but just the "nature-revolting-itself" part. Even though it's not as harmless as a sunset, it's as pretty watch.

As much as I could criticise this new motion picture on many aspects, I have to say that the production design part was relatively good. It wasn't mind-blowing or anything but it was still cinematographically interesting!

## Biggest disappointment : Light writing

Okay, now that we have put aside what I liked in this movie, let come to what I didn't like. **The writing was way too light.** Three minutes into the room and you can already guess what will happen to who and how. **It was way too obvious for it to be actually enjoyable.**

Even if I liked the cast, particularly **Toby Kebbell** (known for his role in Black Mirror) and **Maggie Grace** (Twilight, Taken) the acting wasn't breath-taking either.

If there is one thing that I dislike more than watching bad movies is watching promising plot and images turned into bad movies.

Basically, this movie could have been great, really great. If the writing was a little better, I would have been more lenient on the other aspects. But considering the missed opportunities, I would give it :

## Should you watch it?

Okay. So, honestly for once, I wouldn't really recommend this movie. It did the job of entertaining me but, I'm not sure that if I had to do it again I would pay to see it.  So, **unless you have an unlimited cinema card or unlimited free time, I would suggest that you see another movie instead**.

Here are some movies you could see these days instead :

-   Pentagon Papers \[5/5⭐️\] — [Read my review](/library/pentagon-papers/)
-   The Greatest Showman \[5/5⭐️\]— [Read my review](/library/the-greatest-showman/)
-   Black Panther \[4/5⭐️\]— [Read my review](/library/black-panther/)
-   The Shape of Water \[3.5/5⭐️\]— (review coming soon)

Have you seen Hurricane? If you agree or disagree with my opinion, I would love to talk about it with you in the comments!
