Light and darkness, it has always been a fight between those two forces. Whether we talk about the ambient darkness in the world around us or the world of darkness inside ourselves, it's there. It's always watching and waiting for the perfect moment to disrupt the peace of the universe. But sometimes the darkness is not what we expect it to be. **It seems to be the absence of light, of trust and faith: of love.** As, Meg and Charles Wallace — the main character of the story — discover it at their expense, here is my review of the new **Disney** movie, **A Wrinkle of Time**.

From the trailers and posters I had seen about it beforehand, I knew this movie would not be breathtaking but, as I still struggle to put my thought in order, **I've to say I'm rather mitigated. Or disappointed.**

## Synopsis

After the disappearance of her scientist father, three peculiar beings send Meg, her brother, and her friend to a parallel universe in order to find him \[Source: [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620680/?ref_=nv_sr_1)\]

## Let's fight the darkness within ourselves

I usually love Disney movies. More than just taking us on a new adventure (often very magical), Disney movies and animations invite us to take a close look at and inside ourselves, the way we act, the way we think and the way we see the world. As Meg —  the main character of the story — feels very insecure about her looks, her family and everything people tend to laugh at her for, the adventure she is about to go on will change everything.

> « The only thing in the universe that travels faster than light is darkness. »  — **Miss Which**

But if the movie had an amazing plot (a way to travel through space and time? TAKE ME IN), the result is pretty light and disappointing. We end up in a universe that we hardly know anything about. Add to that the **special effects** and production design that, **for a Walt Disney movie were rather** **mediocre\*\***.\*\*

So yeah, just like for the movie [Hurricane Heist](/library/the-hurricane-heist/), I was rather frustrated by how badly they built the universe and took advantage of the very promising plot.

## Feelings, Feelings. A lot of feelings

### Is it Narnia?

A non-believer girl who goes to a parallel world with her brother to fulfill a greater purpose? From the story to the way it was directed, this movie really gave me a lot of 'The Chronicles of Narnia' feelings. Very Disney-y movie, this is actually the remake of a movie produced in 2003 by ... Disney again (broadcasted on TV).

### Great cast

Storm Reid, Deric McCabe, Reese Witherspoon, Levi Miller and Oprah Winfrey ... I was quite amazed by their performance. Especially those of the little ones **Storm Reid**, and **Levi Miller** who perfectly portrayed Meg and Charles Wallace. I really look forward to seeing them in other movies!

> « We can't take any credit for our talents. It's how we use them that counts. » — **Miss Whatsit**

Oprah's performance was not bad either but, you know it's not really the type of movie where you can appreciate a headliner like her. Except for money I don't see why she was picked as the actor for the role of Miss Which, rather than any other actress.

## ⭐️⭐️⭐️ — 3 out of 5 stars

To break down my rating into a logical system, this is how I would rate the different aspects of the movie :

-   \***\*Acting : 1/1⭐️\*\*** (I quite liked the acting. Especially of the little ones. It wasn't great but it was pretty good)
-   \***\*Writing : 0.25/1⭐️\*\*** (I liked the plot, very much. But I disliked the way they built the universe — you know how I hate wasted plots.)
-   \***\*Production Design : 0.25/1⭐️\*\*** (Honestly, I was rather disappointed. Some pretty interesting angles but I wasn't amazed.)
-   \***\*Directing : 0.5/1⭐️\*\*** (Average, the movie was good but it could have been so much better)
-   \***\*Sound/Music : 1/1⭐️\*\*** (I liked it. Obviously it's pretty hard to miss this point with big artists like Kehlani, Sia, DJ Khaled, Demi Lovato and ... oh god, Ramin Djawadi. It goes  perfectly with the movie and the moment)

That's why, I would give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars rating. I liked the universe, I liked the acting and god I liked the music but, to be honest it was a pretty flat movie.

## Should you watch it?

I think A Wrinkle In Time is for you if :

-   You like Disney movies (not the animations but the movies with actual actors),
-   You like entertaining yet a bit cheesy movies,
-   You like a good morality,
-   You like stories of loyalty,
-   You like explicit fights between the ideas of light and darkness.
