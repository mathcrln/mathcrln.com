## My Opinion ‚Äî ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

You might have guessed it, but I'll say it anyway: **I loved this book**. Absolutely loved it. This story made me think, highlight and think again so much that I actually had trouble choosing only some quotes to put in this article.

### Is racism over yet?

If you had any doubt: I'm black. I always have been and always will be. It's not a choice, just like it's not a choice for anyone to be white, yellow or any other color there is. So why should it be a drawback? Why should my skin color make me a target? The target of hatred, of racism, of fear, and oh well... of cop's gun? Let's not fool ourselves by saying "Oh man! It's 2017, we can live together, slavery, racism, etc, all of that is over". No, we can't. Because it's not. Racism still exists in the skin of many people who aren't even aware of it. How can people decide that their own life is worth more than the one of other people?

> ¬´ He‚Äôs been a cop for as long as Khalil was alive. And I wonder if in some sick twist of fate, Khalil was only born for this man to kill.¬†¬ª

#### Amazing Audio version

It was one of my first times completely listening to an audiobook. And ... as much as I thought I would prefer to read the book on paper, this version was absolutely amazing. Goosebumps, tears, I had the whole lot of them. Trust me, with the voice on **Bahni Turpin** reading The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas you won't only identify yourself with the characters: you'll be one of them.

#### One of the best stories I've read this year

The more I think about it, the more I'm sure of my decision: this book is one of the best books I've read this year. So not only does it deserve a 5 out of 5 stars rating, but it also **deserves to be as recommended as possible**. Be careful, I might soon come knocking at your door and recommend it in person!

## Soon to be a motion picture

Yup. You didn't misread: there's a movie coming! I'm obviously really happy since it's a book I really liked. I just hope that Hollywood won't destroy all the magic and emotions transmitted in this book like they have done so many times before.

> ‚ÄúFunny, slave masters thought they were making a difference in black people's lives too. Saving them from their wild African ways. Same shit, different century. I wish people like them would stop thinking that people like me need saving.‚Äù

I can't say really say more on the subject for now since the trailer hasn't come out yet. But, looking at the cast, something good seems to be cooking up! I can already name **Amandla Sandberg**, **Russell Hornsby**, **Kian Lawley**, or **Common**! Are you as excited about this as I am?

## Let's chat

Alright, that's it for me for today! Have you read this book yet? I would love to have your opinion in the comments.
