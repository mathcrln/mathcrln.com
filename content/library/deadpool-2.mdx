After a very good first movie, Deadpool is back! The sassy and unusual character of the Marvel Comics and Studios make a not-so-discreet return to the theaters by crushing nothing less than Avengers Infinity War in the Box Office. But is it really that good or is it all hype? Here is my review.

## Synopsis

Foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson (AKA. Deadpool), brings together a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy of supernatural abilities from the brutal, time-traveling mutant, Cable.\[Source: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5463162/)\]

## Very good and funny

I'll be straight: I liked Deadpool 2.

I really did enjoy the movie. It was light and fun to watch. The directing was well done so, as a consequence, even if all the aspects (music, acting, etc)¬† weren't great, the experience as a whole was really good!

I especially enjoyed all the references to every possible universes. From music to the MCU, crossing the DCU, Harry Potters and many other things, it was just really funny hearing them all! Bonus point for the writing on that! What I like about Deadpool is that he is aware. He is aware that he is a comics / movie character which makes him aware of his actor and of all the things that happened in other universes like the Avenger's or other.

## ... But sectarian

But, although Deadpool is aware of everything that happens around him in all the universes, the spectators, sat in their chairs in the theaters isn't necessarily aware to. As a consequence of that, people who are not 100% in the Marvel and DC Comics hype sadly miss out on most of the jokes. As an entertainment movie supposed to please everyone that particular aspect could be his downfall.

## Cast & Acting

As for the cast, I really enjoyed seeing Ryan Reynolds portraying Deadpool one more time. The two seem to fit together and i can't imagine someone else playing Deadpool.

I also got to discover Zazie Beetz who plays Domino, Deadpool's sidekick in this second movie. She convinced me with her acting so I'll be following her adventures from now on.

I was only disappointed by the acting of the child,¬†Julian Dennison ak Firefist. I considered it to be overplayed. Or maybe underplayed? The only thing I know is that it sadly ruined a bit of the movie for me.

## Mitigated about the story

For all the other aspects I have to say I am rather mitigated. Even if I enjoyed watching the movie, i have to admit that the plot was pretty light and easily-guessable. I was also dubitative about some scenes or repetitions during the movie but, as I said earlier I overall enjoyed watching it.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüåü ‚Äî 3.5¬†out of 5 stars

I don't usually give half ratings, but for this particular movie I didn't feel like giving a whole number. It didn't feel like a 3 but didn't feel like a 4 either. To help you understand, this is how I would rate the different aspects of the movie :

-   **Acting : 0.5/1‚≠êÔ∏è**¬†(Let's just say that it wasn't the greatest aspect of the movie)
-   **Writing : 0.75/1‚≠êÔ∏è**¬†(Not great but really good. I really had that laugh and enjoyed the jokes or references!)
-   **Production Design : 0.75/1‚≠êÔ∏è**¬†(Some aspects where great, others mediocre so this is a fair rating)
-   **Directing : 1/1‚≠êÔ∏è**¬†(Pieced together I have to say it was a good movie)
-   **Sound/Music : 0.5/1‚≠êÔ∏è**¬†(Even if I liked some songs at particular moments, I was rather disappointed there wasn't an original soundtrack for the movie!)

That's why, I would give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 stars rating. It was good and I honestly enjoyed watching it. Though, as I said it wasn't great in all aspects but I think I rated it fairly.

## Should you watch it?

I think you should watch¬†**Deadpool 2**¬†if :

-   You like comedy movies,
-   You like entertainment,
-   You like Marvel Comics and Super-Hero movies,
-   You're familiar with the X-Men universe,
-   You watched the first Deadpool.
