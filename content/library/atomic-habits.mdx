## Key lessons from _"Atomic Habits"_

From the words of the author, to make a habit stick, **you need to make it part of your identity**. In some ways, you have to _fake it until you make it_. It seems rather psychological but if you tell everyone you are a writer, you will be more likely to ... actually write in your spare time. **Make it a part of your identity so you have no choice but to do it.**

In addition to that, author James Clear share the 4 laws of habit building to make a good habit stick or a bad habit disappear :

### 1st law: Make it _**Obvious**_

Design your environment to make the good habits obvious, but also design the way you think. For example, use implementation intentions : "I will do \[Good Habit\] at \[Time\] in \[Location\]. Mine is: I will read for 10 minutes, every morning after waking up at my desk. The more clear and detailed your habit will be, the more likely you will do it.

Inversely, the aversion of the 1st law is **Make it Invisible**, reduce exposure and remove all cues from your environment. If you don't see junk food around the house, you will be less tempted to eat some.

### 2nd law: Make it **_Attractive_**

Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. If you want to be a reader, make reader friends! That way, the more you'll read, the more you'll feel like you are a part of the community.

Inversely, the aversion of the 2nd law is **Make it Unattractive**, highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits, and design your environment in this idea. If you want to stop smoking, stop hanging out with your smoker friends at every break.

### 3rd law: Make it **_Easy_**

Make it so easy you would be ashamed not to do it. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits and make your environment play its part! That can include putting the book you want to read on your nightstand or making sure your workout clothes are ready the day before.

Inversely, the aversion of the 3rd law is **Make it Difficult**, by increasing the number of steps between you and your bad habits. If you have to re-download Instagram every time you want to browse, you will be tempted to do it less often.

### 4th law: Make it _**Satisfying**_

Our brains like rewards, so **if you want to build a habit, give yourself an immediate reward when you complete it**. It could be as simple as tracking your habit in an app and feeling accomplished!

Inversely, the aversion of the 2nd law is **Make it Unsatisfying**. Like, try to give 10$ to a friend every time you do something you shouldn't, I can assure you it will be painful enough not to remember the lesson.

In the end, **the real key to success is to show up, today, then tomorrow, and the day after that.**

## Why you should read it

One of my first yet favorite reads of 2019, I can’t help but suggest you read "*Atomic Habits"* by James Clear if you want to be successful and live the life of your dreams. Great successes are not about big actions, but about tiny actions repeated for a long time.
