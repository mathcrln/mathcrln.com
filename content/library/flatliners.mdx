What is there after death? People would kill to have the answer to that question (no pun intended). More than the very fact that everyone will know at some point, the mystery seems to troublesome people more than others. But isn't the unknown the true beauty of this perpetual rest: this nameless feeling of being as much intrigued as afraid of what awaits us beyond the ultimate wall? I guess that's what we are going to learn in the movie **Flatliners**, Now in Theaters.

## Synopsis

> Five medical students, obsessed by what lies beyond the confines of life, embark on a daring experiment: by stopping their hearts for short periods, each triggers a near-death experience - giving them a firsthand account of the afterlife. \[Source: [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2039338/?ref_=nv_sr_1)\]

## The Cast

Ellen Page (Juno, Inception, Talhula), Nina Dobrev (The Vampire Diaries), Kiersey Clemons (Dope, EyeCandy), Kiefer Sutherland (24, Designated Survivor, Touch). Basically many actors I know and already love in other universes. Honestly, I quite liked their play in this thriller-like movie.

Oh, and if you didn‚Äôt know, this was actually **an adaptation of the original movie Flatliners released in 1990** and starring ... Kieffer Sutherland ! Since I really like this actor it was a pleasure seeing him again in this adaptation. But let‚Äôs be honest: they could/should have made a little reference to to the original movie.

## My Opinion ‚Äî ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüåü

I liked it. Especially the **actors' play**, the **dialogues** and of course the **concept behind the story**. On a personal note, I'm obviously very passionate and curious about the afterlife, but I think it should remain a mystery.

That being said ... I‚Äôll admit that I was a bit disappointed at the end. The concept was so good and **the trailer put my expectations so high** that the ending really **disappointed** me. They could have done so much more with it that, at the end, I was like : what, it can‚Äôt be already over, right ?

Thinking back about it once out of the Theaters I realized that there were **a lot of inconsistencies**. As much as I like being positive about movies in general, I have to say that **it's a bummer**. What could have been an exceptional concept ended up being just a well-made movie. So what could have been a 5 out of 5 stars review end up being a **3.5 out of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è**, sorry.

I still recommend you to go see it though, especially if it was already on your list.

## Original Soundtrack

Okay, so I know this is an article about Cinema but, let's talk about music. I really enjoyed the whole Original Motion Picture Soundtrack of Flatliners, as much while I was watching it as after (I'm actually listening to 'Untethered' while typing these words). So yeah, if you like a movie soundtrack, you should definitely throw an eye... or an ear!

What's next for me? I'm definitely gonna watch the original version of the movie as soon as possible!
