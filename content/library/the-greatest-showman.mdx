What makes you unique? In a society where we have standards for pretty much everything (beauty, personality, 'acceptable' choices or careers, etc), how can anyone ever live happy ?

Very colorful, very thoughtful and well-directed (and edited) to the smallest details,**The Greatest Showman really amazed me**. Minutes after minutes I was thinking “wow, this movie is gorgeous”. And it is gorgeous as much for the eyes as it is for the ears.

## SYNOPSIS

Thirsty for innovation and hungry for success, the son of a tailor will manage to open a unique and peculiar, never-seen-before, live acts on the circus stage. Some call Barnum a freak and his circus a freak show ! But in his desire to please and be accepted by everyone, he will somehow lose sight of the most important aspect of his life: his family. Will Barnum risk it everything to be accepted? \[Source: [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1485796/)\]

## The Greatest Showman: The Greatest Movie\* ?

### I don't (usually) like musicals

**I've never been much of a Musicals fan.** In fact I only went to see this movie for two reasons: all the actors and all the great and laudative reviews I read about it. But, what was only supposed to be "another movie I watched" **might just be the best movie of the year**.

And I'm not even exaggerating: this movie, its colors, its actors and **most of all its details amazed me from the beginning to the end**.

> “Hyperbole isn't the worst crime. men suffer more from imagining too little than too much.” **— P.T. Barnum**

### A Standing Ovation

I'll be honest on this one: I've watched quite a lot of movies in the past year (thanks UGC Illimité!) and the only time I saw people applaud at the end of a movie was for **Star-Wars: The Last Jedi** ... before **The Greatest Showman**. If you are anything like me (or the rest of the people in my room), **this movie will make you feel so many emotions and admiration that you're just not going to be able to retain your applause**.

## 'A Celebration of Humanity'

The writing part seems to only be the icing on the cake of this seamless movie. As much as I don't want to spoil you anything, I liked how this movie encourages people to accept their uniqueness, settling for what makes them happy rather than always wanting more) and, share the love.

> « Another critic might have called it a ‘celebration of humanity’ » — James Gordon Bennett

## An attention to details

I’m usually trying to find some minus aspects in movies reviews but honestly, I can’t find any. Every details, every elements I could judge it upon would be a solid 10/10. The cast was great and well-chosen, every actor impersonated their character perfectly well. The scenery ? Perfect and very colorful. The images : and I’m talking as much of the camera angle as of its movements. Sincerely, and I don’t usually say that for movies : everything was great. Oh, and I forgot : the transition. God, the transitions were probably the greatest parts of the movie. Going from an era or a place to another seamlessly.

### An amazing cast

**Hugh Jackman**’s acting during the whole movie was just flawless. To be honest, knowing the man as Wolverine, I would never ever have pictured him as P.T Barnum. But he did the job so well, he amazed me !

Past, the main actors, I really enjoyed the whole cast of the movies. I’ll surely remember [Rebecca Ferguson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0272581/?ref_=tt_cl_t5) (Jenny Lind), [Keala Settle](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4745222/?ref_=tt_cl_t8) (Lettie Lutz) and [Sam Humphrey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7976885/?ref_=tt_cl_t9) (Tom Thumb).
