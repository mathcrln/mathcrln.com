Looking for a new show to watch? *Welcome to this new series where I’ll be sharing my favorite shows and tell you why you definitely need to watch them.*

If you are looking for a new show to watch I think I just found the perfect one for you. Between loyalty, aesthetics and great acting, here is why I think you should watch the BBC Australia Show, **Peaky Blinders**.

## Synopsis

A gangster family epic set in 1919 Birmingham, England and centered on a gang who sew razor blades in the peaks of their caps, and their fierce boss Tommy Shelby, who means to move up in the world.  \[Source: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704998/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)\]

## Why should you watch peaky blinders ?

### 1) Because it is aesthetically astounding

If you have been wandering on my blog, for any period of time, you know how much importance I give to aesthetics. **Aesthetics are everything**. From the acting to the color calibration and production design, everything in the show will make you feel pleased and amazed. Oh and no, I'm not exaggerating here.

If I'm being really honest with you, **I could watch this show for hours even if I couldn't understand anything**, the image and aesthetics would be more than enough to keep me entertained for days.

### 2) For the cast: Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy

After Inception, The Dark Knight, and recently Dunkerque, it's quite a pleasure to watch the **Cillian Murphy** and **Tom Hardy** working together once more in Peaky Blinders. Especially as each of them portrays a strong, smart and significant character in the story.

In the show, we follow the adventures of the overall leader of the Peaky Blinders, Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy). Cunning and mission driven, Tommy use his wit to protect his family and lead it to success.

### 3) For the sake of loyalty

Loyalty. How thrilling is it to see men and women ready to lose everything for their family and the one they love. United by trust and family bond, the Shelbys would risk everything and especially anything to protect one another.

### 4) The Ambiance

As it is based on the real story of the Peaky Blinders, the **show brings us back to the 19th century**. We suddenly dive into a story that took place more than two hundred years ago between Birmingham and London. The music as much as the production design helps in portraying perfectly the whole ambiance of the era. Here is the opening theme of the Peaky Blinders, **Red Right Hand** by **Nick Cava** :

### 5) It's on Netflix

Somehow it seems like the magic word: [it’s on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80002479). And there are already 4 seasons seating there, waiting for you to watch them.
