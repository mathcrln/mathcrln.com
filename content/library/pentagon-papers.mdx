What is freedom of the press? Even if we all agree that this is one of the foundations of our society, two questions stand: where does it start and when does it end? In the 70's, after more than two decades of lying to the American people, the US Government tried to deny them this fundamental right. Stunning and thrilling, the new Spielberg movie, **Pentagon Papers**, is about to make you think, a lot.

## Synopsis

A cover-up that spanned four U.S. Presidents pushed the country's first female newspaper publisher and a hard-driving editor to join an unprecedented battle between the press and the government. \[Source: [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6294822/)\]

## For the love of the press

We live in a world where we know politics lie to us but still choose to trust them. Between political manipulations, lobbies and duty of responsibility, nobody knows what really hides behind the scenes of power. That's why the press was created. **To keep the governors accountable and ensure that power is not left on his own**.

> The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.

As the governments and the so-called leaders, consumed by the feeling of power, will always try to hide their mistakes and mischief to the people who elected them, **it is our duty to fight for the freedom of press and the freedom of expression**. To ensure that this fundamental right is not ever, censured by the persons it was built to monitor.

When in 1971, the Nixon administration tried to censure the press for revealing the American government mischiefs during the Vietnam war, **it was the Washington Post mission to publish**.

**Pentagon Papers is a must-watch for political history buffs, journalists, and especially for news enthusiasts.**

## Portray of an inspiring woman

Katherine Graham, stared in awe, by an assembly of women, and men. That is definitely an image to remember!

As we watch Pentagon Papers, we discover Katherine Graham's character, played by the amazing Meryl Streep. After the death of her father and the suicide of her husband, she inherited the ownership of the Washington Post. **If being a woman in this era was not easy, try being a woman trapped between business and politics.**

But, as the movie unfolds itself, we discover a leader, a woman who overcomes her fears, her doubts and uses the strength and the power she never knew she had. To make this decision, to risk her fortune, and the company that’s been her entire life, it's more than just an act of bravery. It's leadership.

## A must watch

I loved it. Without being that much of a Spielberg enthusiast (yet), **this movie gave me the thrills I was expecting**.

To be honest, I'm relatively new in Spielberg's universe so I can't really compare this realization to his previous ones. But, honestly, if this is what Spielberg feels like, I'm very curious to discover him, more and more. **The whole realization seemed flawless, making me smile at little details or references**.

Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Sarah Paulson, and Tom Odenkirk: the cast too was on point. Each actor impersonates very well his character. I particularly liked Tom Hanks' performance in this movie.

> **Pentagon Papers is, in my opinion, one of those movies you add to your « 1001 movies to watch before you die » list as a classic.**

Having always been a fierce defender of the freedom of speech and press, I could only love this movie.  I know it won't necessarily please every audience but I still strongly recommend it to you.
