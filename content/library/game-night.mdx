"You're not going to know what is real or what is fake".  As Game Night introduces the adventures of Max, Annie and the whole gang of game-nighters we suddenly dive into a simple yet suspenseful and funny story. Just like the characters we are left in the dark, not knowing what to expect until the very end. Giggling at every jokes and plot twist, here is my review of Game Night.

Honestly, **it's not my favorite type of movies** so I can't go and give 5 stars reviews and everything, but **I have to say that in its genre, it was very well done**.

## Synopsis

A group of friends who meet regularly for game nights find themselves entangled in a real-life mystery. Lost between truth and lies, illusions and reality, Max, Annie and the whole group will have to figure everything out fast in order to save themselves. \[Source: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2704998/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)\]

> **Annie:** Max is very competitive, as am I. It’s one of the reasons I fell in love with him.

## Plot twist game on point

### Plot & Morals

Great plot and not waste this time, I really enjoyed watching Game Night. A plot, in a plot in a plot? Count me in!

> **Brooks:** This will be a game night to remember. **Max:** Oh, boy.

Not knowing what is true or what is false, Annie, Max and all the other members of the team are gonna have to understand quickly what is going on in order to save their lives. But saving them from what after all, who? It will very certainly be a Game Night to remember.

As I like good morals, I obviously enjoyed this movie where we get to see the sense of loyalty. Okay, it's used and used again, I won't deny it. But, it's still interesting to see being portrayed in a story.

### Great cast

Jason Bateman, Rachel McAdams, Lamorne Morris (New Girl), how can you not like this cast, honestly? I felt that they played great for most of them. As I love Lamorne Morris' acting in New Girl, I was particularly happy to see him in the cast for this movie and, let me tell you that I'm was not disappointed!

> **Brooks:** Someone in this room is going to be taken and it’s going to be up to you to find them.

### Great references

You know how I like a movie with good references right? Sometimes it can change everything ! Quoting MLK, Pulp Fiction, Harry Potter and so many other things made this movie earn this tiny little bonus point. Well done!

## Visual Aspects & Music

### Production Design

To be honest, for a movie like this I wasn't expecting such details and work on the production design but, as it seems, I was surprised! The movie is beautiful to watch. Some camera angles were really great but what struck me the most were the transitions, beautiful!

### Music

Pretty much like the Production Design, I was surprised by the audio quality and soundtracks of the movie. I will be honest, it's not groundbreaking or anything but it fits pretty well with the movie, so that's a bonus point for me!

## ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ — 4 out of 5 stars

To break down my rating into a logical system, this is how I would rate the different aspects of the movie :

-   **Acting : 0.75/1⭐️** (Not perfect or breathtaking but the acting was good and I enjoyed the cast)
-   **Writing : 0.75/1⭐️** (Plot twist on plot twist on plot twist. I noticed a lot of incoherences here than there but, it was still relatively good.)
-   **Production Design : 1/1⭐️** (Great. I visually enjoyed watching the movie)
-   **Directing : 0.75/1⭐️** (Average, the movie was good but it could have been so much better)
-   **Sound/Music : 1/1⭐️** (The music was quite good. Just as intriguing as I like it. And totally fits to the universe!)

That's why, I would give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars rating. It wasn't perfect. Some incoherences, some slowness but in the end I spent a good evening and I would definitely suggest it to you if you want entertainment !

I think you should watch **Game Night** if :

-   You like comedy movies,
