I know I’m very late to the party but I figured it was time for me to give you my opinion on the new Marvel blockbuster, Black Panther. Highly expected by everyone, this new super-hero movie has certainly made an impression! Here's my review of this new opus where we get to learn more about T'Challa, Black Panther and King of Wakanda, introduced in Captain America: Civil War.

**If every super-hero movie is supposed to make kids dream of better days or of a better world**, **this one has a particular taste**, a difference **some** non-colored people might not get or appreciate the first time they see it.

As we know Marvel usually delivers what is expected graphical wise, let's disccus the morality and politcs of this highly anticipated movie.

## Synopsis

T'Challa, the King of Wakanda, rises to the throne in the isolated, technologically advanced African nation, but his claim is challenged by a vengeful outsider who was a childhood victim of T'Challa's father's mistake. \[Source: [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/?ref_=nv_sr_1)\]

## Finally getting that representation

**‘Representation’ is a hell of a word these days**. Every community asks for it and usually those who are not a part of it don’t seem to understand why, so I’ll try to explain it to you. TV, Cinema, books and the press play a great part in our education and the way we picture not only the world but I place in it. **If you are white, straight, average height, Christian and you come from a western country then you have no problem figurating that part out.** You have no problem picturing you being Captain America, the President of the United States or even that regular hero that “saves the day”. **But what if you’re not?**

What if you’re black, Asian, gay, curvy, Muslim, or anything else and that all TV ever tells you is that you either don’t belong or that you will have the secondary role. That “uncommon friend”, highly stereotypical (accent and traits) and usually the one who will die first?

Representation is important. And, **if as a white guy or girl you feel uneasy with this “all black” movie, then you will understand how we feel about 95 other percent of the cinematographic productions.**

## The Black Pride

More than just representation, this movie is about giving Africans (and the whole Black Community) back their pride. Finally picturing a African country way over the West, not only in the technological field but also with values, way of governance and other aspects.

> What a country of farmers could ever bring to us ?

**More than just an heroic movie, this is a movie of facts, of history.** A movie that shows, in its own way, the consequences of colonization, apartheid and racism in Africa and in other countries. It even shows that after centuries of struggles and, decades of "racism doesn't exist anymore", the West still tend to look down on Africa and its constituents. Even when the actual power is in their hands.

## Culture and researches

Even if I’m not African, nor do I know the culture and ways of populations in countries of Africa, I still think that efforts and researches have been made by Marvel to show actuals clothes and represent the different cultures and influences. For once, it's more than just some clichés bullshit.

For me it will be a 4/5 stars. The movie was good but, Marvel always could have done better.

There were not big but I noticed some incoherences and things that could have been done in a better way, that could have been more realistic. But, nevertheless, as I think you might have guess it, I really really liked this movie.

## Should you watch it?

I think you’ll like **Black Panther** if :

-   You like super-hero movies,
-   You like the Marvel Comics Universe
-   You want more representation of 'minorities' in books, tv shows and movies
-   You like technology and movies that make you dream
-   You want to see change in the world.
