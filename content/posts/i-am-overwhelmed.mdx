Things, **things**, things.

I have always had a tendency to get stressed by things. I mean, even going to the grocery store with the overflowing crowd tends to be a difficult experience for me. So, hard to picture what doesn’t.

But, **one thing that particularly stresses me out is all of the clutter in my life.** Whether digital or physical goods; over the last 20 years I lived on this Earth, **I can’t believe I have gathered so many things.** Hundreds of books, multiple game consoles, computers, notebooks, pen and … oh god, clothes. **So much clutter to fill my brain with.**

## The Hedonic Treadmill

I made so many things enter my life because **I thought I didn’t have a choice.** I was taught very early by society itself that life is a race. The more you have, the faster you go. So I kept on buying, again and again. **I mean, I lived the race for what it was.** Even if I never really was a compulsive buyer (being very pragmatic tend to take the fun out of shopping), I still bought way more things than I ever needed.

I kept on wasting money because **I wanted to impress people, or maybe was it to impress myself?** To that expensive computer I bought, that pair of headphones, or even that DSLR I thought would make me take amazing pictures: **who was it really for**? For most of my existence, **I kept running that Hedonic Treadmill, thinking that my life would be amazingly better with more stuff in it**. But what if it wasn’t the way? **What if I did have a choice?**

## When less is more

I started getting rid of a lot of things when I understood that **more than making me poorer, they were actually making me sick.**

I started giving out books I knew I would never read (or did read but never liked).

I gave (or threw away) clothes I was not going to wear anymore.

Books, clothes, but also cables, shoes, accessories: I got rid of all the clutter that was filling my life. And, even if I’m not done yet, **merely the process of it has a tremendously good effect on my mental health** and my productivity. **Less has started to become more.**

Today I feel like **I finally started living according to my principles because I made them a priority.** I removed all of the clutter that was clouding my judgment every day and finally paved the way toward having a more fulfilling life.

## **Let’s chat**

Now, what is your take on the minimalism concept? Do you think you could apply it to your life? If not, what would be the blocking point according to you?
