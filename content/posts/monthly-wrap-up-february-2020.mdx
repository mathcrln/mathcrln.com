As expected, although January felt too long, February was quite a short month. I will admit that this last month was not the easiest for me, as felt quite tired and slow to reach my goals but nonetheless, I stay proud of what I‚Äôve accomplished and learned in the last 28 days. Here is what I‚Äôve been up to in February 2020!

## Health Wise: physical and mental fatigue

I think that was the main part of the month. January was amazing and I accomplished a great number of things but it also drained me and left me quite tired, both physically and mentally. In consequence, I started February at a slower pace than January, I took more time to rest and relax but, most of all, I stopped running after things.

This month, I just realized that life is just like a river. You can fight against its current, or you can surrender to it, and embrace it. I chose the latter and it actually felt quite good. Funnily enough,¬†[when I stopped running after time, I found more of it](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=46f3d8f20bd328d717295b4c2&id=eb6ce40f6a), I enjoyed more moments and I felt calmer.

## On creating

I feel like I created less this month than last month or the ones before that, or at least I was less organized with my content creation. But funnily enough, it‚Äôs also this month that I received some very precious feedbacks and support from friends and other creators, so that‚Äôs a win! Here is what I created for you on the blog :

-   [The fear of missing out](/blog/fomo/)
-   [Where and how to start blogging #2](/blog/where-and-how-to-start-blogging/)
-   [Life is a journey, not a race](/blog/life-is-a-journey-not-a-race/)

I‚Äôve been a little bit MIA on the other creative fronts as well, but I still achieved some work done, whether for clients or for school so I am proud of it.

## On learning

Sadly, the month has also been rather slow on the learning front as well. Why is that? I read quite a lot, but a bit less than in the previous months. This month, I started (but haven't finished yet):

-   The biography of [Steve Hobs by Walter Isaacson](https://amzn.to/2wjatAB), really love it so far.
-   [A Discovery of Witches](https://amzn.to/39e28fP) by Deborah Harkness (there is a TV Show adaptation to this book but I didn't get much into it ‚òπÔ∏è)
-   [Checklist Manifesto](https://amzn.to/2TdDztX) by Adul Gawande, really insightful so far!

Overall it seems like February was rather heavy of a month on me, but it's alright. I learned how to prioritize my health and myself overall and I'm happy about that. March is usually my lucky month so I'll see how it goes!

## Let‚Äôs chat

Now, what about you? How did February go for you? Did you also feel very tired or rather the contrary?
