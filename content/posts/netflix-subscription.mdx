**Toudoum**. If instead of just reading the previous word you heard it in your head then yeah, just like me, Netflix has conquered your life. Earlier this year, I decided to cancel my subscription. Crazy, right? Well... hereâ€™s why.

## How Streaming became the center of our lives

Netflix, Apple TV, YouTube, Hulu, HBO and thatâ€™s only to quote the main ones... In the last 10 years, these companies have been on their path to one goal: to **conquer our attention**. With a catalog of movies and shows that couldnâ€™t be watched in a lifetime, itâ€™s easy to fall into the "Netflix and Chill" lifestyle: get home after school or work, change into your PJ's, and **start binge-watching** the latest show until way past midnight.

> I had embraced the Netflix lifestyle head first.

There is nothing wrong with that. I was there some months ago, maybe you still are by choice and that's totally normal. Yet, day after day, I kept saying that "I didn't have time". I didn't have enough time to make concrete progress on my goals or sometimes to hang out with friends. Netflix, Social Medias had conquered all of my attention and **I had no mastery whatsoever over my time.**

## Put your money where your mouth is

So, around March 2019, I made the conscious choice to cancel my Netflix subscription. Donâ€™t get me wrong though, I still absolutely love movies and I still watch many of them but this one decision meant that, for once,Â **I would pay myself first**. I would stop caring about whether I watched the last show that everyone is talking about but rather [put my goals at the top of my priorities](/blog/what-are-you-working-on/).

Itâ€™s not that much about money (although on a student budget the Monthly 9.99$ does matter), but rather because I want toÂ **put my money where my mouth is**. If, in a monthÂ **I can only allocate my money and attention to a few things**, then I would like toÂ **choose those that contribute to my long term goals**.

I value learning and experiments, so I replaced my Netflix subscription with an Audible one. I gave myself 'carte blanche' to buy any book I fancied on my [Kindle](/blog/e-reader/) and I started saving money to go out more often and plan some trips abroad.

> Instead of waiting on society to hand it out to me, decided **to put myself first** and I **chose to build my own lifestyle**.
