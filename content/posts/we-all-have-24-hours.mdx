When you look at Bill Gates, Elon Musk, or even your average startup founder, it’s easy to feel like you’re not enough. That these guys have a secret reserve of time allowing them to found and grow multi-billion dollars companies while we can’t even finish our [Netflix](/blog/netflix-subscription/) episode on time.

Yet, they don’t. We all have 24 hours in a day. As Seneca puts it: *« It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. \[...\] Life is long if you know how to use it. »*

We spend too much time worrying about not doing enough, too much time being afraid of « what will happen if... ». We give all of our [creative power](/blog/am-i-creative/) to doubts, fears, and laziness because we are afraid to show the world what we can achieve. We worry about not doing when we could just... do.

So today, I challenge you to take one step toward one of your goals. It could be as tiny as writing a paragraph if your ambition is to write a book. Or, a line of code if you want to build an app. Whatever is that thing you want to do but can’t seem to make progress on: take 10 minutes (yes, only 10 minutes) to work on it today. I mean, as busy as you are, you can afford 10 minutes for something that matters to you, right?

Hopefully, it will help you get rid of your [creative](/blog/creativity-myth/) block. Please, tell me in the comments what you’re working on!
