Hi friends,

So, you might have noticed, I haven't published in quite a while. It's not that I lack ideas (I have plenty) or motivation (I have some of that too), I believe it is a bit more than that. **I feel lost.** And before getting back on my usual schedule with my usual posts I felt like I needed to talk with you face to face (or keyboard to screen, you get me).

## I feel lost

It is not new. I think I have always been lost in a way. **Lost in my thoughts, lost in my projects, lost in this world in general.** I think way too much for my own good and before I know it, I'm overwhelmed in a sea of thoughts that sometimes tend to turn dark.

I feel lost, I feel phased out, I feel stressed. I struggle to explain my emotions because I struggle to understand them in the first place. I have this overwhelming feeling of pain, this ball of stress that plays flipper in my stomach. **For once, I have the guts to say it: I'm not okay and I can't handle everything.**

I know I shouldn't, but to be honest, I feel ashamed feeling like this and even more ashamed about writing it here, on the internet. But I needed to take those thoughts out of my mind and to write them down. First for me, as a way to get them out of my system; then for people who struggle like me and have the same issues, just so they know they are not alone.

## Running out of time

I'm always running and, as it seems, always running out of time. If I had always been like that (needed to feel that I was making the most of my time), it has started to become an illness. **Nowadays I don't know how to be bored**. If I'm not active, whether on purpose (like deciding not to do anything on a weekend) or not (procrastinating on something) I start feeling extremely bad and guilty.

**I suffered through burnout in 2015 and, I now realize that I never really recovered from it.** I'm constantly going up and down on this roller coaster they call life, and it's messing me up. **There is nothing more frustrating than knowing I will never be out of the cage that is my mind**, that I will never be as efficient and active as I was before.

I always knew that I was my own worst enemy, but I never expected the fight to be so hard. I know that I will fight until the end to find my way out of the darkness, but how long is this tunnel, when will I be out?

## What about you?

This article is not meant to be a call for help, nor is it a self-pity post. I just wanted to share what complex emotions I had on my heart and mind. However, if you ever suffered through similar feelings I would be more than happy to talk about it with you in the comments!
