After mentioning it on Twitter, I was particularly eager to show you what I have been working on in the last few weeks and months, my new personal website!

## What is Jerry

Named Jerry, and built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, and **GraphCMS**, this is my first attempt at fully defining my online presence and branding. Personal blog, business card, and portfolio, Jerry is my new home on the internet.

## Why I built my personal website from scratch

I‚Äôve been publicly on the internet for a very long time now. Around 2012, I published my very first blog, using Blogger. It was in French by then üá´üá∑ and it gave me the joy to be able to share my ideas and discoveries with the wider world (although by then, I didn‚Äôt have many visitors).

Then, curious by nature, I tried out other solutions‚Ä¶ Wix, Squarespace, Tumblr (to only name a few) before settling with Wordpress since 2013. Since then, I bought themes/templates on ThemeForest, tweaking them here and there to match my needs, all the while longing for the day I could finally build and control everything about my personal website. **Today is that day**.

So, I built Jerry as a challenge to myself. I wanted to practice a wide range of skills that I intend to sell to potential recruiters and clients: design, accessibility, SEO, implementation with React & GraphQL, and mostly the process of going from ideation to shipping a full ‚Äúproduct‚Äù to the world. üö¢.

So, as a way to sum up, I built Jerry as a way to‚Ä¶

-   Have a clean, dedicated, and controlled space on the internet where I can showcase both my ideas and skills
-   Play out with some technologies I was interested in and get experience in shipping a full project to production
-   Make it easy for recruiters or clients to find information about me, my skills, my interests, and my expertise
-   Have some form of a playground to continue iterating and learning

## How I built Jerry

Jerry has been months in the making. Not because it was that hard to build, but because it was that hard to ship and iterate with. As a first solo ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù project, I kept overthinking every decision, from the initial design to the technologies I would use. As a perfectionist by nature, I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to bring to the world something that wasn‚Äôt perfect, at least in my eyes.

### My iteration process

It all started on paper where I put down what I considered I wanted or considered essential:

-   Pages to introduce myself, my projects
-   Articles / Blog section to showcase my ideas, discoveries, expertise
-   Dark / Light Mode Switch
-   Form to subscribe the newsletter
-   A way for companies to find out information about me (Resume, etc.)
-   Responsive and readable on most devices
-   Great SEO practices
-   Great accessibility practices

Then, after sketching down a low-quality mockup I started designing in Figma defining the color scheme for light & dark mode, as well as the brand new logo you can see at the top of this page. From there, I iterated between design, code, and migration of my 98 previous posts from WordPress to this new platform.

### The stack I used

As I mentioned in the intro, here is ‚Äúmy stack‚Äù for building this website :

-   **Design:** Figma
-   **Host:** Vercel
-   **CMS:** GraphCMS
-   **JS framework:** Next.js (React)
-   **CSS Framework:** Tailwind
-   **Miscellaneous:**
    -   Apollo GraphQL
    -   Typescript
    -   Markdown (Next-MDX Remote)
    -   Plausible Analytics

## What I plan for Jerry going forward

Jerry is‚Ä¶ far from being a finished product. As I mentioned earlier, my plan is to make it a continuous playground where I can regularly experiment and leverage my newfound skills.

## What is available now

Right now, you can:

-   See all of the blog posts I have published so far
-   See all books and movies I have reviewed in the past
-   Switch from Light to Dark Mode (and vice-versa) or let your OS do it automatically for you

### What is coming soon (short-term)

-   Newsletter form & archives
-   Stack (a list of the tools I use)
-   Resume + Hire me page for recruiters

-   Write a lot more and build more projects
-   Case studies for projects
-   Show featured posts on home instead of just more recent ones
-   "Links page" to quickly access frequently visited pages from Social Media
