It‚Äôs quite scary isn‚Äôt, to live? To have the weight of the world on your shoulder. One day you‚Äôre a kid, whose only job is to play and be nice, and suddenly the party is over: you‚Äôre an adult now and it‚Äôs time to behave, to stop acting like a child and to find something (hopefully good) to do for a living. But is it really the only option? In my opinion, whatever you do in life, you should **never forget how to play.**

## How to adult 101

One thing is certain, growing up sure does take the fun out of things. We get so knocked out by the weight of responsibilities (earning money, being responsible, doing taxes, laundry, dinner, etc), that we quite forget how to play. Suddenly it‚Äôs as if the kid you were a few years ago never existed. Naah, you must be better, act better... be an adult even if no one ever quite handed you the ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù manual for it.

Don't forget how to play, awake the child in you!

But I believe there is more than meets the eye. I believe growing up doesn‚Äôt have to be reduced to that.¬†**We can‚Äôt allow ourselves to forget how to play, to forget what it feels to be so passionate about something that you forget everything else**. Knowing how to play is the best gift we have,¬†**it‚Äôs the key to access our holy creativity**.

## 3 ways to get some of your kid‚Äôs spirit back and play

### 1. Call some friend to organize a game

What I like about sports is that... when you‚Äôre really into it, you forget about everything else. And there is something quite peculiar about playing a ball game (whichever one) with some friend, without any pressure to score or to have a good result. The only real goal is to get some steam out of your body and find the best way to humiliate your friends (or be the one to be humiliated üòÇ).

Don't forget how to play, call a friend and organize a game!

### 2. Spend a lazy Sunday

Whether you choose to let it happen or not, chances are it will happen anyway. At least in my situation. So I would rather do it consciously and enjoy every minute of it rather than feel guilty about it. Whether you have a thousand things to do or not, you can allow yourself a short breather, just a few moments to remind the kid inside you that you don‚Äôt forget him, that it deserves your time also.

### 3. Don't forget how to play and go on an adventure

When I was a kid everything seemed like the greatest adventure. Even just going to the garden or doing the laundry or whatever: if it was something new, you‚Äôd find me in Aden ready to learn. Then everything stopped, curiosity faded and responsibilities became the norm: basically, life became boring. So my advice to you (and to myself) is to find some of that child kindle back. Either go on big adventures or travel or just... make them come to you, by changing the way you see all the little things you get to do everyday.
