Iâ€™ve been craving movie soundtracks lately. For reading, writing, working out, or just getting through that mess we call life. For some reason, it has almost become the only thing I listen to on a regular basis. Not only does it allow me to cut all distractions out when I try to focus on a particular subject but **it also makes me travel to other universes without even moving from my chair**.

## Why you should try reading with music ðŸŽ§

Iâ€™ve often caught myself **completely daydreaming while listening to soundtracks**. As if I was floating on air, in thoughts or musical notes. Itâ€™s more than just the lack of singing though: these songs were designed to make our dream and experience emotions in movies. **Except that, when there is no image for the brain to see, it has to make up for it and create them. Just like it does for books.** That is part of the reason I think **books and soundtracks are lifelong best friends**.

## **5 of my favorite movie soundtracks to read, chill and work ðŸŽ¶**

So, have you ever tried reading, working or just chilling with soundtracks from movies? Whether you have or you have not, get ready to put that headphone on your head because here are my absolute favorite soundtracks recommendations :

### ðŸŽ§Â *Light of the Seven* by Ramin Djawadi (from Game of Thrones)

It is actually from a TV Show rather than a movie for this one but that's not the point. There is no real contest here, Light of The Seven is absolutely my favorite soundtrack by far. An astounding melody betweenÂ piano, organ, strings, and a few voice solos to make you dream. Approximately 10 minutes long this song perfectly bottles deep emotions, melancholy, and a tiny bit of nostalgia.

It was originally made for an epic scene at the end of the 6th season of Game of Thrones but I can assure you that you don't need to watch the show to connect with this song. Even if I use it for multipurpose (reading, working or just calming my mind when I'm stressed out), **I found it particularly enjoyable when reading adventures books like The Lord of The Rings saga by J.R.R Tolkien or the "Autre-Monde" (Translation: "Other World") sage by Maxime Chattam**.

### ðŸŽ§Â *Time* by Hans Zimmer (from Inception)

In addition to being one of my favorite movies ever, *Inception*Â is also at the origin of one of my favorite soundtracks. With Violins, violas, cellos, concert basses, and many other instruments, **Hans Zimmer has perfectly depicted in music the very concept of "Time"**. And as a result, I often lose track of time while listening to it, as if I was ... dreaming? Speaking of which, I need to rewatch that movie soon.

I usually listen to the studio version on Spotify, but here's the Live version for your ears and eyes, don't thank me ðŸ˜˜

Also Hans Zimmer is an absolute genius, I just needed to state that here.

### ðŸŽ§ *The Imitation Game*Â by Alexandre Desplat (from The Imitation Game)

This is typically the perfect example of our a music can make me want to watch a movie. Now that I am in love with this song I cannot not watch The Imitation Game, especially as Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock, Doctor Strange) and Keira Knightley (Pride and Prejudice) are the main actors.

In the same genre as _Time_ I just introduced, this song is for me a direct passage from this dimension to another. I actually added both [to my playlist named "Silence ðŸ¤«" on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/mathljp97/playlist/5pCvIppVdlvRFXLEnSP30J?si=Pjz9flotRT-4_TvWgjJjBA).

### ðŸŽ§ *The Presses Roll*Â by John Williams (from The Post)

Original Motion Picture Soundtrack from one of my favorite movies of the year, the Post / Pentagon Papers ([read my review](https://mathcrln.com/culture/cinema/pentagon-papers-freedom-of-press/)), The Press Roll by John Williams brings a dramatic yet very intriguing atmosphere the second you play it. As a result, it's probably perfect as a reading background if you like reading mystery, police or thrillers books.

### ðŸŽ§ *Rey's Theme*Â by John Williams (from Star Wars)

Did you really think I would not put a Star Wars reference here? I mean, come on. Joke apart, Rey's Theme (from The Force Awakens as you might have guessed) is a beautiful and interesting jam to let your mind wander and go on its own adventure or, follow the adventures of your favorite book characters.

<YouTubePlayer id='65As1V0vQDM' />

With two songs in my favorite soundtracks list, I would say that **John Williams is an absolute genius too**. Especially as he **is also the one behind most of the Harry Potter soundtracks**.

I think that's about it for today. Obviously, I have thousands of other soundtrack recommendations to give you but it would have been way too long for me to type and for you to read. Although, please tell me if you enjoyed this new format and would like me to do it again in the future ðŸ™Œ
