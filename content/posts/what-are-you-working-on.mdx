Here is why you should think about what you prioritize.

> “Tell me what you value and I might believe you, but show me your calendar and your bank statement, and I’ll show you what you really value”

So what is it you are saying that you do? What is that long-term goal or project you tell everyone you are working on? **We are often blinded by our own words, thinking that because we say something, we are necessarily doing such a thing.** But, most of the time we don’t really.

A few weeks ago, I launched the new version of the blog. Besides the obvious design change, I decided to change… well, everything else. From the topics of my posts to the way I promote my works, I even changed my approach to writing. Part of these changes concerned my posting frequency. **Whether it’s snowing, raining or I’m traveling, my goal is to deliver meaningful and insightful content to you every Thursday at 7 pm.** **Yet, here I am, a few hours before my deadline, writing these very words.** But how did I get there?

As much as I would like to say “Well, I didn’t have time guys; sure you can understand, right?”, it’s false. I had all the time in the world. **The truth is, I didn’t prioritize.** I knew how much it meant to me and how fulfilling it would make me feel; yet, in my actions, I failed to give it the proper importance and time. **Despite just telling you how important it was to me, I didn’t make it a priority.**

And, that’s what I want to talk about with you today.

## Identify what you really value

> "Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least." **— Goethe**

Now, back to my original question: what is that long-term goal or project you tell everyone you are working on? Whether it’s building your own business, working out every day, learning a new language, or improving your writing, you need to identify what you **really** value and what has the most impact on your life.

## Do. Or do not. There is no try

That’s what Master Yoda tells Luke in _Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back_ when he teaches him how to use the force. Who doesn’t love a good Star Wars reference? However, the Grand Master has a point here. **Either you do value something and make the time for it or you don’t**.

I know it’s harder than it seems though, so here are a few tips to actually make time for what you love :

### 1\. Spend less time on Social Media

Now that you know what has the most impact on your life, you need to identify what doesn’t. If you are anything like me, you have the reflex to open your phone and start scrolling through Instagram or Twitter whenever you have a few minutes to spare. But 5 minutes plus 5 minutes… at the end of the day, you have spent 2 hours watching Insta stories without even realizing it.

### 2\. Make sacrifices

I know it’s tough, but **love is about sacrifices**. As like me you only have 24 hours in a day, you need to make sure you use them for what you really value. And yes, that means refusing to go out with friends sometimes or maybe choosing to watch your favorite show later. But it's okay because you will be betting on your long-term happiness, not just the short-term one.

### 3\. Schedule your priorities

> The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule but to schedule your priorities. **—  Stephen R. Covey**

The best way for you to prevent yourself from slipping away from your deadlines and from the things that are important to you is too … schedule the times when you are going to work on them. That way, when the time comes, you can’t escape it.

### 4\. Get down to it

Well, it's rather straightforward at this point. If you intend to make progress in a field, you don't have much choice than... to do it. You will often come across your brain or body’s **resistance**, trying to prevent you from achieving anything but you need to fight through it. I can promise you, **starting is the hardest part of any project.**
