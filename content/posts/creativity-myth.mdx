Are you creative? Or rather, do you consider yourself to be creative? I know I certainly don’t. School project, blog posting, photography, music \[...\]: time and time again have I caught myself saying this four words sentence: “I’m not creative”. But am I really?

## The fear of disappointing

For as long as I can remember, I have blocked my creativity out. Trying very hard to fit in society, at my young age I hid my creativity, and in a way, a bit of my personality, in a closet. Whenever people would ask me to create something, I would first state that « I’m not creative » so they wouldn’t expect too much from my work. **Since « I’m not creative », it won’t be my fault, right?**

I’ve made myself deaf to compliments of people around me. Yes, I write well, but ... not as I would want. Yes, I’m good at this or that, but ... it’s **far from being enough**. Why do you all people keep on thinking I’m so good when I have no talent whatsoever?

I’ve manufactured myself the best excuse there could be: **If the universe didn’t give me the gift of creation, then why the hell should I try to create?**

## Creativity is not a gift, it is a skill

Creativity is not a gift, it is a skill. Do you think Leonardo Da Vinci painted Mona Lisa on its first try? Even if he did have a particular attraction to drawing and painting and all that particular branch of art, he only got to that level of creativity and talent because he practiced it, every day. **He improved himself the only way he knew how: by creating.** And I think that’s how we should all approach it.

In order to improve your creativity, you need to accept the fact that it’s okay if your work doesn’t have “that special thing” you want it to have, yet. You will improve enough to get to that point ONLY if you accept that it is a work in progress and you keep on creating.

Too many amazing creators gave up at the beginning of their adventure, frustrated by their own limit at the time. I know that because I have been on the verge of quitting more than once. **But, that’s what is: an adventure. Isn’t it?**

## Some resources on creativity
