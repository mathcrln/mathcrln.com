Also known as FOMO, the Fear of Missing Out is this intrinsic feeling we all have that **somehow, someway we just missing out on something that could be valuable to us right now**. Of course, it’s not something new, but in recent years, with Social Networks and their dozens of daily notifications, with all the technology at our reach, FOMO has spread like wildfire. If like me, it has become a problem in your life, **here are a few ways I found to overcome it**.

## Focus on the here and now

On a daily basis, I personally can’t help but check my emails, my WhatsApp or Twitter notifications just to make sure I didn’t miss anything important. And it gets even worse when I’m actually waiting for something... **to the point where it’s not even healthy anymore**. And I’m admitting this to you because I know I’m not alone, there is a good chance that you suffer from FOMO, just like me.

Whenever it happens, **I just try my best to focus on the here and now**. Sure, there is still an infinite number of possibilities, there are still thousands of things I could be doing at this very moment, but I’m choosing to focus on only one of them at a time. **Whether it’s the “right” or the “wrong” choice at the moment, it’s my choice and I won’t know its outcome until I try.**

## Any opportunity will come later anyway

Don’t rush on any decision (especially if it’s important) because you think you will never get “such an amazing opportunity again”. You will. And this doesn’t mean that you should always postpone any important decision, of course not, but **you should never take any decision driven by fear**.

Any opportunity that arose before you will arise again later anyway, probably even better. *Funnily enough, the same day I wrote this post, I was tempted by an amazing opportunity and they say I only had 09 hours and 39 minutes to get it... I was really tempted and got overthinking right away, only to realize that... at the end of the day, the website still displayed the same countdown.* _It's their priority to make me a customer, doesn't mean it should be my priority to become one._

Whether it’s the new iPhone, a business opportunity, or anything else, always remember that **anything could stand in front of you but it’s your choice to decide what you do with it**. **You’re in control and you have more power than you think.**
