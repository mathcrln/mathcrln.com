It is that time of the year again. I just came back from Berlin a few days ago and I finally found the time to think about my resolutions for the new year. I know it's controversial but I like the idea of _New Year's Resolutions_. Just like Monday marks the beginning of a new week, I believe new years open the door to a new life, for those who are ready to take it!

But, before telling you what I plan to achieve in 2019, I want to thank 2018 the right way.

## Bye 2018, thank you for everything

Seems like just yesterday I was stating my resolutions and [explaining why I wanted to 'simplify my life in 2018'](/blog/2018-a-year-of-change/). Yet, the time has come to wrap up the year and get ready for a new and particularly exciting year.

### Did I really simplify my life?

I believe I did. Well, I'm not a monk living in a faraway monastery with only water and bread to feed (not yet anyway), but yes I did simplify my life this year!

A great deal of this change came after I read "_**The Magic of Tidying Up**_" by **Marie Condo**. The KonMari Method _(which I will talk about more on the blog later)_ helped me get rid of the physical clutter in my life. Books, clothes, but also cables, shoes, accessories: after giving or throwing away most of them, I can finally breathe and [stop being overwhelmed](/blog/i-am-overwhelmed/).

But this is not all. I also worked a lot to change and simplify the way I make decisions, the way I think, and the way I interact with people. I stopped giving time to toxic and opportunist "friends" to actually build beautiful and hopefully deep friendships I can be proud of.

> There is no point arguing: 2018 was the best of my life, so far.

### A year of experiences

**2018 was a lot of "firsts"**, in failure as much as in success. It made me learn a lot about myself and discover what I want to value in the future. It's hard to sum up a whole year in a few words though, so here is what I am most proud to have achieved this year:

-   Being accepted in the school of my dreams for September 2019,
-   Building amazing relationships both on the Internet and in real life (I'm sure you'll all recognize yourself),
-   Becoming more decisive and less pragmatic/apprehensive,
-   Finding love and understanding what it means,
-   Stopped being afraid of making mistakes and just ... going for it,
-   Reading more than 34 books ([my Goodreads goal was 30](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38439849-mathcrln)) including classics, self-help, science and fiction books,
-   Writing my Personal Mission Statement (will write about that soon),
-   Cutting my hair,
-   Launching a new version of the blog, and a Newsletter ([subscribe here](/newsletter/)),
-   Traveling around the World (Martinique and Berlin),
-   And so many other things!

Travel, discoveries and experiences? 2018 was the best year of my life, so far.

## 2019, a year of challenge

### Learning, more and more

**I want to dedicate my life to learning. All-day, every day.** And it means building my life around that idea. By reading more than 50 books, learning computer sciences, prioritizing new experiences over routine, and many other things, I want to get out of my comfort zone as often as I can.

> I will sleep this year with my head full of dreams, staying confident that, no matter how hard or how long it is, I will get there eventually.

### Creating, again and again

Whether by writing, speaking, coding, shooting pictures, or videos, I live to share and to create from what I learn. This year, I want to create, day after day, new content from which both you and I can learn. **More than quality or quantity, this time, I will bet on consistency** and deliver original content every day/week/month, on the blog, and [in the newsletter](/newsletter/).

### Be me

Finally, and this might just be the most difficult resolution to achieve: this year **I want to learn how to be myself**. Learn how to say no to what I don't like in order to **say bigger YESS's to what I do like and want to give time to**. Even if it's only a few hours from time to time, I want to break through the noise of social media, work, and the overall craziness of life to spend time at peace, with myself.

> I want to make 2019 a year of a challenge when I will finally make some progress on the path toward my dreams. Will you come with me?
