If you are new on the blog or you would just like to know me a little better, I put up together 9 things you probably don‚Äôt know about me.

## 1\. I don‚Äôt like chocolate

Shocking, right? I can‚Äôt count the number of times people have made fun of me or seemed shocked by my statement. But yeah, even though I might be tempted sometimes I don‚Äôt particularly like chocolate. Or red fruits for that matter.

## 2\. I‚Äôm a feminist

I‚Äôm a feminist. And, of all the things I am and I can be, this is one of those I‚Äôm most proud of. Whether close to me on a personal level or famous, most of the inspirational figures in my life are women. But, for me ‚Äúbeing a feminist‚Äù is not just an empty statement. It means that I‚Äôm ready to educate myself on the subject and to fight, alongside women, for what I believe in.

## 3\. I look older than I actually am

Well, the title pretty much says it all but yeah, people often told me I look older than I actually am. Let‚Äôs just say that being tall and being serious most of the time doesn‚Äôt really help.

## 4\. I‚Äôm a Know-It-All

I don‚Äôt know why, I just have this urge to learn and to know everything. It‚Äôs most of the time frustrating but, well, I like being curious. And there are so many fascinating things in this world, how could I ever close my eyes?

## 5\. I support the LGBTQ+ Community

Before anyone of you ask: I‚Äôm straight. I‚Äôm, for sure, physically attracted to women and, as it seems, mentally too. But I‚Äôm strongly supporting the LGBTQ+ Community. I just want a world where everyone has the right to be happy, whatever that implies.

Actually, I just await the day when these communities won‚Äôt have to use labels to gain back their pride. The day when gay or queer or trans people won‚Äôt have to come out anymore. The day when it will be normal to fucking love whoever you want, unapologetically.

So yeah, like feminism: even though I‚Äôm not directly concerned, it‚Äôs a fight that is close to my heart too. That implies that I want to be more educated about it so, I strongly advocate for more diversity in books, movies, and pretty much everything else.

## 6\. I‚Äôm an Introvert

Considering most of my activities it might seem difficult to believe it (or not), but I‚Äôm an introvert. And, as much as I like to learn things from other people, I just like to be alone. It tends to be the only way I can actually rest.

## 7\. I‚Äôm good at sensing things, and people

I actually am pretty good at it. I wouldn‚Äôt know how to explain how I can do it or even how to explain the feeling, but I can sense people most of the time and have a taste of their values and principles. About making friends? Yeah, I should more and more listen to my instincts.

## 8\. I‚Äôm good at adapting to people and situations

That is actually an aspect of my personality that I like as much as I dislike, but I‚Äôm usually good at adapting to things. This means I‚Äôm a fast learner and I do my best not to stand out in most situations.

## 9\. I love languages

Always loved languages and probably always will. I love analyzing how people and things communicate together. In my lifetime, I would like to be fluent in a bit more than 10 international languages. Plus, I would really like to improve my knowledge in computer/web languages and sign languages, Braille or Morse. Oh, did I tell you I was a Know-It-All?

The more time will pass, the more I want to be proud of my values and what I believe in. I want to get to the point when I can live an apologetic and stress-free life.

## What about you?

So, now that you know me a little better, come tell me one thing I don‚Äôt know about you in the comments üëá
