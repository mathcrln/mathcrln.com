I was expecting to enjoy **London** but, you know, the same way that you like big Cities. But, for some reason,¬†**it seems that the British Capitale has made it to my heart**.

## The Story ‚Äî¬†5 Days in London

So, if you follow me on Social Media (and especially on Instagram), you probably know that I was in London for some days last week. As many people have been asking me: why is that? Why was I in London? First thing: it is neither work nor blog or anything related.¬†I have been wanting to visit _the City_ for years now, but for some reason I always postponed.

> To be honest I also really needed a break from work, stress, and the typical "Parisian life".

You probably won't believe me, but a squirrel literally climbed on me in this Park

From the weather (that was way more lenient than I expected) to the people and the culture of the city, I really liked this first stay in London. Also, I absolutely love the English language so it was really interesting to actually get to speak it in front of native people and hear them answering me. Let's say **it was basically cool just being in an English atmosphere.**

I'm as much a lover of the City as the Countryside. London like Paris and every metropolis is very polluted (ambient pollution), very populated hence very stressful but, this time it didn't matter.¬† I found it gorgeous and I fell in love with the British Capitale ‚ù§Ô∏è. Am I a Londoner already? ‚ú®

## Things I would suggest in London

Planning to visit London soon too? Well, here are some ideas I could throw on your bucket list...

### Place to go to

-   **Camden.**¬†It seems like the whole world suggested me go visit Camden and I did. Well ... kinda. It was actually the last day and I didn't have that much time left so I went there, visited some stores and markets, bought some stuff then left. But if you have more time than me, **I definitely advise you to go there**!
-   **Oxford Street**. Almost like our typical _Champs Elys√©es_ or rather our Parisians _Grands Boulevards, Oxford Street is a huge and gorgeous commercial Street located in the heart of London. Since I went there in mid-November I was amazed by the beauty of the street and its Christmas lights. Oh, and in this street, you'll find **the famous "Harry Potter-themed Primark"** everyone has been talking about these past weeks (as a matter of facts it's not that crazy but anyway)._
-   **Forbidden Planet Store.**¬†Not that far from Oxford Street, you'll find a direct portal to Heaven.¬† Just kidding (well, kinda).¬† I went to this store recommended to me by [_Clara from The Book Worm of Notre Dame_](http://thebookwormofnotredame.wordpress.com) and I absolutely adored it. Basically, if you like any universe from Harry Potter to Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, Marvel, DC, etc., you will be at home ü§©. I didn't buy that much stuff but I sincerely spent hours in this store.
-   **Jamie's Italian Restaurant:** One of the first places I went to in the capital on a recommendation from my host/friend and I adored it. Lovely place to eat and delicious food. Especially the desserts!

### Things to do

-   **The London Eye**. Quite expensive I will confess (¬£26), but definitely worth it! From the London Eye, you can see the City ... from the sky. It's really impressive so yeah, I definitely recommend it.
-   **Eat Fish&Chips**. Fat, a bit queasy, but unavoidable, I named: Fish&Chips. You can't go to London and not taste it. It would be like going to Canada without tasting a Putin or Beavertails.
-   **Eat an actual English Breakfast.** Pretty much the same description as the Fish&Chips. It could be a bit strange to taste in the morning if you're coming from another Culture but you definitely should try it out anyway!

![Trust me, when you are on top of The London Eye, you feel like on top of the World.](https://d3n92f24kh3qcr.cloudfront.net/images/0r0P064US0ajuEl3t8ev.jpg)

### Things to see

Those might be obvious choices, but those are some places I think you should definitely see :

-   Westminster Palace/Big Ben
-   Buckingham Palace
-   St James Park
-   The London Bridge

That's it for my journey to London. But, what about you: what's the last town (or country) you discovered?

> Oh, and don't worry London, **it's only Goodbye**. I definitely intend to come back, ASAP.
