Hi readers,

September was easily the best month of the year for me. Nothing groundbreaking happened in the outside world but, so many things happened on the inside. As I prepare myself for the beginning of a new month, I can’t believe how much I learned about myself in September. Welcome to my Monthly Wrap-Up, September edition.

## September in a Nutshell 🐚

September was marked by two ideas : renewal and perspectives. I had just came back from my trip in Martinique (learn more about it in my [Summer Wrap-Up](/journal/summer-2018-wrap-up 'Summer 2018 Wrap-Up')) and, beside my full-time work, I had approximately a whole month to make progress on my projects and prepare myself for the upcoming season, before the start of my classes this week. But, in this short laps of time, I learned more things about myself than I thought I would. And, more importantly I finally made progress toward [my resolution for 2018: “Simplify my life”](/journal/2018-a-year-of-change/ '2018, a year of change'). Here are some things I achieved in September:

-   I woke up every morning to breathe, read, think and sweat,
-   I worked out at least 4 times a week in the past 4 weeks,
-   I finished 8 books (which is a whole lot for me in a month),
-   I got rid of clothes, books and other things ([read my post “I am overwhelmed](/journal/i-am-overwhelmed/ 'I am overwhelmed')),
-   I launched a the new version of the blog,
-   I will launch a newsletter tomorrow,
-   I bought a new phone,
-   I have planned a trip to Berlin this Winter,
-   I started feeling productive and creative again,
-   I discovered a bunch of new places and restaurants in Paris
-   I’ve completely re-thought my approach on writing, learning and creating content.

## What I created for you this month

### New website

Here it is: The new version of the blog (7.0) is here! I have been working quite a lot on it so I hope you’ll like it. With this new version of the blog I had three main goals:

-   Improving the user experience, especially your reading part,
-   Simplifying the format and getting rid of the unnecessary,
-   Giving more importance to the actual content and writing.

Don’t hesitate to tell me what you think of it in the comments!

### A newsletter

I’ve been thinking about it for months and maybe years, but I finally launched it! Starting tomorrow, I’ll be sending one email a month to my subscribers. In this letter called “Renewal”, I will be focusing on two main ideas: Creating & Learning.

### New blog posts

I wrote quite a lot in September, but only published two articles (plus this one), and an article in French for the “Bokantajénès” project of my friend Alychouette.

-   [I am overwhelmed](/blog/i-am/overwhelmed)
-   [Summer 2018, Wrap Up](/summer-2018)

Starting next month, you can expect an article every **Thursday at 19:00** on the blog.

## What I learned this month…

### … in books

E-books, Audiobooks, paperback: for probably the first month in my life, I finished more than 8 books! And, I couldn’t be more proud of myself. After suffering with a reading-slump for 3-4 months I finally caught up with my Goodreads challenge this month. And it was rather diverse, as I read books about science, productivity, psychology and fiction.

If you are interested in any of those books (or have read them), I would be delighted to talk about them with you! Also, I have some projects to share everything I learned in future blog posts, so you might want to follow that 😏

### … about minimalism

I learned quite a lot about minimalism and, just like last month, I will suggest you to watch [Matt D’avella’s videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany) if you are interested in the subject, or if you are interested in film making. His podcast [“The Ground Up Show”](http://mattdavella.com/podcast/) is also an amazing resource for content creators.

### … about myself

Sort of awakening for me, this month I finally caught up with my principles and my values. I finally understood what they were and why I wanted to live by them.

-   I started saying “No” to things I didn’t want or need in order to give bigger “YES” to what is important for me,
-   I have earned a lot of self-confidence as much with my body as with my mind and personality. Now I’m okay with trying things that I used to think “weren’t for me”.
