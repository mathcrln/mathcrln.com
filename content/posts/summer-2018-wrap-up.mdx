Hi everyone,

Long time, no see, right? Yes, I am well aware that I haven’t published anything in more than two months. Do I feel bad about it? Not as much as I would have thought. After working full-time for a year and stressing out about my blog (just like with every other part of my life), I just decided to take a tiny break and for once, relax and not post for a little while. But now I’m back! And I want to tell you about all the things I have been up to during the time I was gone. Here is my Monthly Wrap-Up, Summer 2018 Edition.

## The Summer in a Nutshell 🐚

I guess the most obvious part of my summer was … my travel to my Home Island (if you are new to this blog, I lived most of my life on a tiny French island in the Caribbean called Martinique). The beach, my family, the freedom to be alone on the road … I finally found a time and a way to breathe. Want a sneak peek?

It wasn’t all perfect, though. A lot of little misadventures happened to me while I was there but for once I allowed myself to choose my own reaction and “accept it” rather than panic and stress out. And, having that “freedom not to react” is the best feeling I felt in quite a while.

As for the rest of the summer, I did quite a lot of interesting things too !

-   I went to Disneyland Paris for the first time\* \_(it was awesome, I can’t wait to go back now),
-   I went to the “Parc Astérix” which is another great attraction Park in Paris,
-   I discovered 3-4 new amazing restaurants in Paris that I can’t wait to review on the blog for you,
-   I saw Ed Sheeran and Bruno Mars live in the Stade de France (with Anne-Marie and DNCE being there, which was awesome),
-   I started working on my “Personal Mission Statement” and perfected my Morning Routine,
-   Discovered quite a lot of new resources and content creators,
-   Went hiking on a volcano and down a cascade,
-   Oh, and I almost forgot, I cut my hair !

Well, I think that’s about it for this summer. Overall I feel more grown, productive and intellectually mature than I felt two months earlier. Now let’s see what I read, watched and discovered in two months time.

## My favorites of the month 🌟

### On reading 📚

In reference to my last article before the summer break [“5 books I am planning to read this summer 📚”](/library/books/books-summer-2018/ '5 books I am planning to read this summer 📚'), I actually did catch up with some books on my TBR, but not all of them ! I mostly chose to focus on my re-read of the Harry Potter saga (currently in the middle of book 4), as well as some morning reads like :

-   The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey
-   Sapiens: A brief history of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari
-   A brief history of time by Stephen Hawking
-   Je suis un zèbre (read: “I am a Zebra”) by Tiana

I currently have two other books on my bedside tables for when I have time to dive into:

-   La disparition de Stephanie Mailer (read: “The disappearance of Stephanie Mailer”) by Joël Dicker
-   Wonder-Woman: Anthologie (comics) by various authors.

### On movie-watching 🎞

I haven’t been much of a movie or TV watcher lately, but I did manage to see the following movies :

-   The Darkest Minds,
-   Blackkklansman,
-   The Passenger,
-   Equalizer,

### Some resources I have discovered

I recently discovered [**Matt D’Avella**](https://mattdavella.com/), who is an amazing content creator (podcaster and youtuber) and a minimalist. His youtube channel has quickly became something of an obsession for me. Especially when I discovered that he directed the movie “**[Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things](https://minimalismfilm.com/)**” which I watched and loved two years ago.

I also discovered : [**Sara Dietschy**](https://www.saradietschy.com/), [**Roxine Kee**](https://www.roxinekee.com/) and a whole bunch of content creators who inspire me to get better, everyday.

In the technological corner, I have also changed most of my gear … on my phone at least. Here are the new, yet essential apps in my pocket :

-   [Notion.so](https://www.notion.so/),
-   [Habitify](https://habitify.me/),
-   [Tide](https://tide.moreless.io/en/),
-   [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/),
-   [1password](https://1password.com/fr/),
-   [Strava](https://www.strava.com).

I might talk more in details about all of that in future blog posts.
