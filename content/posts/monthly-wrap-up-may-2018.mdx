After starting this new series of posts last month with*, I am back for a new episode!*  Quick yet so slow,  quite full but a bit empty, **here is what I've been up to in May 2018 !**

If last month was quite complicated for me as I write in my [**January to April Monthly Wrap-Up**](/monthly-wrap-up-january-april-2018/), going through demotivation and feelings of emptiness, I have to say that this month was worlds apart! Inspired, motivated, and organized, I definitely feel like I kicked May's ass!

## May in a Nutshell 🐚

As quick as it was, I really enjoyed the month of May. Not only did amazing things happened to me in almost every areas of my life but, it is also the month I found my motivation back ! I could not explain to you where it came from, I just know that it came and, for as far as I'm writing this post, it still lasts. Here are a few amazing things I did this month :

-   I went to the rooftop of the Montparnasse Tower in Paris (amazing view, I'm definitely going back!)
-   I started eating well again and saving money (by eating less — almost none —junk food),
-   I had a tasty brunch at my house with friends,
-   Went to the concert of [_an artist_ from my home island I like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6DaDuGshpE) with my family,
-   Started supporting _[Sidaction](https://www.sidaction.org/)_ (a french non-profit developing AIDS programs around the world) with a monthly donation,
-   Finally booked my plane for this summer,
-   I got inspired and started acting (researching and organizing) on some projects...

... and many other things ! I really enjoyed going through this month and I hope the next one will be even better.

## My favorites of the month 🌟

Here are all the pieces of content, whether books, movies, songs or articles I would suggest you this month :

### Let's talk about books 📚

Sadly, in May I was in a bit of a reading slump so I didn't get that much reading done. I spent most of the month on a single book that ... wasn't even that long. Anyway, I hope next month will be better on that particular area!

As a result, this month, I only managed to read **_History is All You Left Me_ by Adam Silvera** but I made progress is several other books I'm planning on finishing this week.

-   Bizarre ! Bizzare ! by Roald Dahl
-   The Decaying Empire by Laura Thalassa
-   History is All You Left Me by Adam Silvera

You can see all of the books I read and recommend on my _[Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38439849-mathcrln)_.

### What about music? 🎶

If the complete playlist is way too long for me to share everything, here are some of the vibes I enjoyed listening to this month :

-   [_**Shawn Mendes** (album)_](https://open.spotify.com/album/6AjREacSERvnQTe6GFTx3c?si=aHrd-hr9TiO5tzls5Oyh3g) by **Shawn Mendes**
-   [**_Que Sera_**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0lnfcWRREvnGtXPP2ZDeq7?si=P2Mq5ZpfQMK1qLylrirCcQ) by **Wax Tailor**
-   [_**Ready Player One** (Original Movie Soundtrack)_](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Adz7CJkuXjKOufPbRe5Qk?si=M1Si30oNS3ybTQUIXvRCUA) by **Alan Silvestri**

Plus, as usual, some very mainstream songs that I have listened to on repeat :

#### _Strongest_ by Ina Wroldsen

#### _Done for me_ by Charlie Puth (ft. Khelani)

<YouTubePlayer id='TdyllLZeviY' />

### Movie Time 🎞

In addition to going back to watch _**Black Panther**_ ([read my review](/library/movies/black-panther)) and _**Avengers: Infinity War**_, this month, I watched :

-   Solo: A Star Wars Story
-   Deadpool 2
-   Truth or Dare
-   Padmaavat

If you are interested, I actually published [a review of _**Deadpool 2**_](/library/movies/deadpool-2) on the blog.

Here's one of my anticipated movie releases of June! I am so gonna be sitting in the theaters on June 6th, the day of release (in France) of _**Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom**_. You can already expect a review from me 😉

### Articles i published this month 👨🏾‍💻

As opposed to last month, this month I've been pretty effective on the blog and published no less than 6 posts (if you count this one) ! Apart from my usual movie reviews, I tried new formats and topics for you. Hope you liked it!

-   [Monthly Wrap-Up, January to April 2018](/monthly-wrap-up-january-april-2018/)
-   [Ready Player One: an escape from reality?](/library/movies/ready-player-one/)
-   [5 reasons to watch Peaky Blinders](/library/tv-shows/5-reasons-to-watch-peaky-blinders/)
-   [How to organize your blog life 📝](/blog/organize-your-blog-life/)
-   [Deadpool 2: is it as good as the first?](/library/movies/deadpool-2)

My blogging goal for next month is to keep the posting steady with two posts each week (on Monday and Thursday). I would love for you to tell me which are your favorite topics 😉

## Some intriguing ideas 💡

I'm back at being an active reader on Medium.com ! Medium, just like TED, is one of my favorite websites out there. I get to read very interesting and inspiring articles that end up improving my productivity and way of seeing the world. Here are some interesting pieces of content I connected with this month:

-   [_**Revisiting the Habits of Highly Effective People**_](https://medium.com/s/the-test-of-time/revisiting-the-habits-of-highly-effective-people-ebceca669193) by *Melody Wilding* on **Medium**
-   **_[Lessons from My Math Degree That Have Nothing to Do with Math](https://medium.com/s/story/6-life-lessons-from-my-math-degree-that-have-nothing-to-do-with-math-d38aba90edfe)_** by *Alex Korchinski* on **Medium**
-   [_**Why we should quit Social Media**_](https://www.ted.com/talks/cal_newport_why_you_should_quit_social_media) by _Cal Newport_ on **TED**
-   **_[The Secret Life of a Highly Sensitive Person](https://medium.com/s/story/the-secret-life-of-a-highly-sensitive-person-e5e49ab4918b)_** by *Melody Wilding* on **Medium**
-   [_**Discovering Your Other Self**_](https://medium.com/s/real-magic/discovering-your-other-self-f6decd9dfff) by _Mitch Horowitz_ on **Medium**

I have a lot of others just as much interesting, but I think it will be enough for today haha. If you don't know Medium or TED yet, **I highly suggest you to give them a try**. Those are two platforms I would love to publish content on one day!
