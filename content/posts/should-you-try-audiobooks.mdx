Hey readers,

By this time, I think that you pretty much all know how much I like reading. Whether from printed books, ebooks, or audio versions, I enjoy discovering new amazing stories, new points of view to broaden mine every day. Yet, a few years ago I wasn’t that much into audiobooks... If you’re still there, here’s why you should give it a try.

### “But I like to read every word on the page”

I know and me too. But audiobooks are a completely new experience to reading. With a nice voice and a good narrator, you won’t just hear the story, you’ll be a part of it. One time I was in the boring Parisian subway, half asleep on my way to school, and the second after I was standing next to Starr and Khalil in Angie Thomas’ “The Hate U Give” story.

Not every book is made to be listened to and definitely not every narrator is good but, some are excellent and you should definitely try the experience. I promise you won’t regret it!

### Where to start, which platform to choose?

Now, if you are convinced and you want to start your first audiobook you have multiple options. Personally, I use Audible, which has a nice interface and a subscription system. Every month I pay 9.99€ for a credit, which allows me to download one book, whatever its original price was. Like, recently I downloaded the « Sherlock Holmes: The Définitive Collection » which is 81 hours long and cost a good 90€ normally... for a fraction of that price.

Depending on the country you live in, you might have other options, like Audiolib in France.

### 5 recommendations for audiobooks to try today

There are many books I could suggest here, but I’ll stick to 5 in different genres.

If you like fantasy or romance, one of my absolute favorite narrators is Bani Turpin. She has narrated **[Children of Blood and Bone](https://amzn.to/2QoFsmI)** (by Tomi Adeyemi), the breath-taking **[The Hate U Give](https://amzn.to/35dpm3z)** (by Angie Thomas), **[They Both Die At The End](https://amzn.to/2OiSj7h)** (by Adam Silvera).

If you like Self-Help, I would highly suggest finding the books narrated by their original authors, it adds a lot of depth to the listening (you feel like you’re listening to a podcast). My picks: **[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://amzn.to/2OitloG)** (by Stephen R. Covey), **[The Power of Habits](https://amzn.to/2Kt0Ray)** by Charles Duhigg or **[Deep Work](https://amzn.to/2XmDWDd)** by Cal Newport.

Finally, for amateurs of Science, I would highly suggest **[Sapiens](https://amzn.to/354EZKk)** by Yuval Noah Harari (trust me, it’s better to listen to it than to read it) or **[A brief History of Time](https://amzn.to/359XVaS)** by Stephen Hawking.
