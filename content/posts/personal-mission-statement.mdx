Among the books that have had the most influence on my life to this point, I would quote without hesitation _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_ by **Stephen R. Covey**. More than just being inspirational and well written, this book drove quite a lot of change to my daily life. One of the key takeaways from it is the importance of **writing and living by a Personal Mission Statement.** And that’s what I’d like to dive into, in today’s post.

## What is a Personal Mission Statement?

In [_The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_](/library/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people/), Stephen R. Covey considers our daily lives to be revolving around one center. In his words:

> « Whatever is at the center of our life will be the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power. » — **Stephen R. Covey**

He argues that, we were all handed a set of maps and filters to see the world, in our childhood. These maps are the ones dictating our actions and reactions in our everyday lives. For example, **if you’re a pleasure-centered person, you’ll look for opportunities to find pleasure and fulfill your desired**, but get very annoyed at things that don’t. Same if you are a money-centered or spouse-centered person, your center will influence the way every situation in your life impacts your mood, your decisions, and your sense of self-worth.

But, according to the author, **we have the power to change that, to create our own set of maps**, in the form of a Personal Mission Statement. Simply enough, a Personal Mission Statement is, as the name suggests, a personal constitution, a map of your design, allowing you to be the leader of your own life. It’s a way to put **what you value the most in the center,** too **begin with the end in mind**.

> **“He who has a why to live for can bear almost anyhow.”** — **Friedrich Nietzsche**

## Here’s My Personal Mission Statement

When I finished reading the book for the first time back in the summer of 2018, I had some time to reflect on my values, my priorities, and my ideas of a perfect life. I did a personal introspection and, to be honest, I wrote quite a lot that summer! But, influenced by all the other texts and reflections, the most important one came in the form of my Personal Mission Statement, which I would like to finally share with you today.

> I live to learn and to create.
>
> Whether from books, from movies, people, or experiences, I breathe to discover the world. I shall then build my daily life accordingly in order to be **constantly surrounded by learning material.**
>
> Whether by writing, speaking, coding, shooting pictures, or videos, I live to share and to create from what I learn. **I want to create emotions and share knowledge with the world**. I shall then make sure I feed my creativity by exercising it every day.
>
> In order to live a **happy and fulfilled life**, I want to **never stop creating** and especially to **never stop learning**.

I’ve been reciting it in my head pretty much every morning since September 2018 and this text has influenced many moments of my life. Whenever I felt in doubt about some decisions to take, I could rely on it, see how it aligned with my values: « will it teach me something or help me to create? ».

To some extent, it made me realize that I was responsible for the choices I make in my life and **it lead me to slowly start leading a life of my own design, lead by my own priorities**. In many ways, it made me start putting areas like the blog, newsletter, or even travel first, and **paved the way for an actual fulfilled life, with growing opportunities and moments of joy**, while creating or learning.

## Updates to come

Yet my life has evolved quite a lot since 2018. I learned so much, I grew so much. And without changing the core behind it, I would like to reflect all of these changes into my Personal Mission Statement in the course of the upcoming weeks, maybe months. If I do, be sure I'll keep you updated, when the time will be right.
