Okay, I know by that time it's getting pretty late to talk about the summer as if it wasn't there. But it's never too late to talk about books, right? Even if I'm still working a full-time job and am still 3 weeks away from my vacation, I thought it would be interesting to share with you some of the books I am planning to read before the end of the summer, in September.

## What I like to read during the summer üëì

Do you have a genre of books you particularly like reading during the summer or do you just stay in line with what you are reading the rest of the year and take the first book that pops out of your TBR? It's probably clich√© (or is it?), but I have to admit that I enjoy reading thrillers and romance during the few weeks I'm completely off and disconnected from the real world and its troubles. Somehow I find it easier to read those very intense books during the summer break and keep either the fantastic stories or self-help books (because I do read lots of those) for the rest of the year. Although my TBR contains some of those this year, I definitely know what I am most eager to read!

### üìñ G√©n√®se¬†(Autre-monde) by Maxime Chattam

I already talked quite a lot about it on the blogs already ([4 best books I read in 2017](/blog/4-best-books-of-2017/) / [5 movie soundtracks to read, chill and work](/blog/movie-soundtracks/) üé∂), but this saga is one of my favorite discovery of this season. And I have to admit that getting to the 7th and last book (except for potential future spin-offs) is making me particularly sad. So, I will take all my sweet time to read and appreciate every single word of this last book. If you are looking for a great adventure books in French, I definitely suggest giving a try to this saga.

#### Synopsis

As Matt Carter ‚Äî the main character of the story ‚Äî wakes up one day to a world that had completely changed where adults either disappeared or were changed into monsters, he and all the other children left have to learn how to survive in a new world. But when dogs are as high as horses and nature as concentrated all of the impurities and artificial creations.

### üìñ Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi

I can't count how many times I have heard about this book since its release ! If, obviously I am a bit afraid of being disappointed because the hope was too high, i have to admit that I am really intrigued by this book and that I want to discover the story as soon as possible.

### üìñ La Disparition de Stephanie Mailer by Jo√´l Dicker

Being my favorite french (he is actually swiss) author, I can't wait to finally read the new release by Jo√´l Dicker. Typical thriller I like to read during the summer, it will be the perfect companion on the beaches during my break. Oh and I am so glad I met the author and got that book signed !

### üìñ Wonder Woman War Bringer¬†by Leigh Bardugo

I absolutely love Wonder Woman's character and everything about her. So this summer, I will finally get to dive into this book that have been watching me from the top of my shelf for ages. You probably should expect a review on the blog !

#### Synopsis

But when the opportunity finally comes, she throws away her chance at glory and breaks Amazon law‚Äîrisking exile‚Äîto save a mortal. Diana will soon learn that she has rescued no ordinary girl, and that with this single brave act, she may have doomed the world. \[Source : [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29749085-wonder-woman)\]

### üìñ A Brief History of Time: From Big Bang to Black Holes by Stephen Hawking

Not the typical summer read you would expect but this summer, if I get the time I would love to read and learn more about Stephen Hawking's researches and ideas about physics and black holes. Even without knowing specifics about his researches, I always felt very inspired by him and his works.

#### Synopsis

Told in language we all can understand,¬†*A Brief History of Time*¬†plunges into the exotic realms of black holes and quarks, of antimatter and ‚Äúarrows of time,‚Äù of the big bang and a bigger God‚Äîwhere the possibilities are wondrous and unexpected. With exciting images and profound imagination, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets at the very heart of creation. \[Source : [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3869.A_Brief_History_of_Time)\]

## All the other books I am planning to read üìö

New year, new Harry Potter readathon! Even if I still don't know how I am going to find a room for it into my schedule, re-reading the Harry Potter saga is definitely one of my goal for this summer. I have read it exactly to years agos around the same dates and I have been missing them ever since. Although I am not a great fan of ALL the movies (except the 1st, the 3rd and the 7th part 1 & 2), I am a also planning to-rewatch them as soon as I will finish reading.

Despite this huge pile already waiting for me I have also set my eyes on a few books that have been waiting for me in my bookshelves for ages. They include, in no particular order :

-   **Turtles all the way back** by John Green,
-   **Nineteen Eighty Four** by George Orwell,
-   **The Fault in Our Stars** by John Green,
-   **Percy Jeackson 1 & 2** by Rick Riordan
-   **Oliver Twist** by Charles Dickens
-   **Depuis l'au del√†** by Bernard Werber (translation : "From the other side")

I can't promise myself I will read them all during the summer, but I'll definitely do my best to reach that goal. Although my priority or now is mostly to take the time needed to fully enjoy every adventure in every book.

Well, I think that's all for tonight. I thank you all for reading and I hope you found some books inspirations for this summer.
